abstract: We find that the increased supply of college graduates resulting from
  college enrollment expansion in China increases college premiums for older
  cohorts and decreases college premiums for younger cohorts. This finding is
  inconsistent with the canonical model that assumes substitution among workers
  of different ages. We subsequently build a simple model that considers
  complementarities among workers of different ages and different skill levels.
  Our model predicts that the college premium of senior workers increases with
  the supply of young college graduates when skill is a scarce resource. The
  model's predictions are supported by empirical tests.
