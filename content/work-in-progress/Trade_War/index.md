Abstract: This paper investigates the impact of the US-China trade war on China’s innovation intensity and the technological linkages between China and the US. Employing textual analysis to gauge the resemblance of China’s patents to the recent and past US patents, the paper finds that an increase in the firm-level exposure to US export tariffs results in a decrease in the similarity of China’s patents to US patents, particularly the most recent ones. China's innovation similarity to other developed countries decreases at varying magnitudes, highlighting the multifaceted nature of innovation beyond mere quantity. Furthermore, the analysis reveals that the export tariff reduces patent filings in China. To elucidate the mechanism, we integrate the textual analysis algorithm into a quantitative economic model that features firm-level export and innovation decisions on multiple products towards countries with heterogeneous preferences. The model’s predictions align with the empirical findings, and further quantification examines how market demand channels influence the intensity and direction of Chinese innovation.
